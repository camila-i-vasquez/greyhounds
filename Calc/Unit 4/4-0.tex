\section{Introduction}
We are coming back from a well-deserved break and there might be some cobwebs.Work through these problems, they should all be review from the start of the year. Some will be computational, some will be conceptual. 
\section{Practice/Homework}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fill in the blanks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The derivative is the \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} rate of change
\item The derivative of a function $f$ at a point $a$ is the \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} of the line tangent to \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} at \rule{1cm}{0.15mm}. 
\end{enumerate}
\item The derivative of $\ln(x)$ is 
\item The derivative of $5x^4$ is
\item In general, the derivative of $x^a$, where $a\neq 0$ is (what is the power rule?)
\item If I have a function that looks like $f(g(x))$, then the derivative of this function is:
\item The derivative of $e^{x^2}$ is 
\item The derivative of $(x^2+3x+1)^7$ is 
\item Write the product rule here: 
\item The derivative of $xe^x$ is
\item The derivative of $\cos(x)$ is 
\item The derivative of $\cos^2(x)$ is 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bonus question: What methods can we use to solve the derivative from problem 11 (there are several)?
\end{enumerate}
\item The derivative of $\sin(x^2)$ is 
\item The derivative of $\frac{x^2+1}{x+2}$ is 

\end{enumerate}
